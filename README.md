### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kodi (he/him) 
Welcome to my GitHub! 

I'm a(n),
- :computer: Full Stack Web Developer
- :musical_note: Unknown hiphop force 
- :muscle: Athlete
- :video_game: L4D2 Tryhard

and I'm looking to make my debut in the Software Development industry.

The majority of my experience up to this point has been creating web applications all over the stack. Check out some of the technology I know how to use!

## Front-end:
- React.js
- Redux
- HTML/CSS
- MaterialUI/TailwindCSS/MaterializeCSS/Styled-Components

## Back-end:
- Node.js
- Express Web Framework
- JWT
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite3

## Languages:
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Python

And I'm open to and capable of learning many more. 

I'm currently working on projects that combine TypeScript with React and Node, with a specific focus on improving my web capabilities regarding React practices, authentication, and interfacing with CSS/UI libraries to speed up production. 

If you're interested in working with me please feel free to leave me a message [on my website](https://theko.dev/contact). I look forward to chatting with you!
